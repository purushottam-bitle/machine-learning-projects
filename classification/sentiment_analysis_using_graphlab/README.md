# Predicting Sentiments from product reviews

### Summary

In this module, we focused on classifiers, applying them to analyzing product sentiment, and understanding the types of errors a classifier makes. Built a jupyter notebook for analyzing the sentiment of real product reviews.

### Tutorial Steps
* Import graphlab
* Loading the Dataset and Loading reviews for a set of baby products.
* Exploratory data analysis **(EDA)**.
* Build the word count vector for each review.
* Examining the reviews for most-sold product: **'Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether'**.
* Build a sentiment classifier.
* Define what's a **positive and a negative sentiment**
* Let's train the sentiment classifier.
* Evaluate the sentiment model.
* Applying the learned model to **understand sentiment for Giraffe**
* Show most **positive reviews for the giraffe**
* Show most **negative reviews for giraffe**
