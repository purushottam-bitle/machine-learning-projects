# Regression Predictive Model

### Summary

In this tutorial we worked through a regression predictive modeling machine learning problem
from end-to-end using Python. Specifically, the steps covered were:

* Problem Definition (Boston house price data).
* Loading the Dataset.
* Analyze Data (some skewed distributions and correlated attributes).
* Evaluate Algorithms (Linear Regression looked good).
* Evaluate Algorithms with **Standardization** (KNN looked good).
* Algorithm Tuning (**K=3** for KNN was best).
* Ensemble Methods (Bagging and Boosting, Gradient Boosting looked good). (Not covered)
* Tuning Ensemble Methods (getting the most from Gradient Boosting). (Not covered)
* Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset).


Working through this case study approach showed you how the steps for specific machine learning
tasks can be pulled together into a complete project. Working through this case study is good
practice at applied machine learning using Python and scikit-learn.
