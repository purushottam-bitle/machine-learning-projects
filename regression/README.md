# Summary

<p>In this tutorial we worked through a regression predictive modeling machine learning problem
from end-to-end using Python. Specifically, the steps covered were:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Problem Definition (Boston house price data).</li>
    <li>Loading the Dataset.</li>
    <li>Analyze Data (some skewed distributions and correlated attributes).</li>
    <li>Evaluate Algorithms (Linear Regression looked good).</li>
    <li>Evaluate Algorithms with **Standardization** (KNN looked good).</li>
    <li>Algorithm Tuning (K=3 for KNN was best).</li>
    <li>Ensemble Methods (Bagging and Boosting, Gradient Boosting looked good). (Not added)</li>
    <li>Tuning Ensemble Methods (getting the most from Gradient Boosting).</li>
    <li>Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset).</li>
</ul>

<p> Working through this case study approach showed you how the steps for specific machine learning
tasks can be pulled together into a complete project. Working through this case study is good
practice at applied machine learning using Python and scikit-learn. </p>
